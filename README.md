Robot Arm with 5 DOF

Project Description

This project aims to design a 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm using Tinkercad. The arm’s movement is controlled by various joints to simulate the motions of robots that can interact with objects in different environments.

Details of the Degrees of Freedom

The arm consists of five main degrees of freedom, as follows:
	1.	Base:
	•	Rotation around the horizontal axis of the base. This allows the robot to rotate left and right.
	2.	Shoulder:
	•	Movement of the arm up and down, similar to the human shoulder. This movement enables the robot to raise or lower the arm.
	3.	Elbow:
	•	Movement of the arm forward and backward, similar to the human elbow. This allows the robot to move closer to or away from objects.
	4.	Wrist:
	•	Rotation of the lower part of the arm, similar to the human wrist. This movement allows the arm to rotate in multiple directions.
	5.	End Effector:
	•	Finally, the end effector, which may be a gripper or another tool, can move independently, such as opening and closing the gripper or using the tool to perform specific tasks.
